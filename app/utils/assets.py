"""
Hashed asset resolution for bundled frontend files.

`scripts/build-js.mjs` emits content-hashed bundles into ``app/static/dist/`` plus a
``manifest.json`` mapping a stable logical name to the hashed path, e.g.::

    {"core": "dist/core.a1b2c3d4e5f6.min.js"}

Templates reference the stable name via the ``asset_url()`` Jinja global::

    <script src="{{ asset_url('core') }}"></script>

This replaces the ad-hoc ``?v={{ app_version }}-toastfix1`` query-string busting that
was scattered through base.html: the hash changes only when the bundle content
changes, so browsers cache correctly across releases that don't touch the asset.
