# Calendar/Agenda Support Documentation

## Overview

The Calendar/Agenda feature in TimeTracker provides a comprehensive view of all your events, tasks, and time entries in one place. This feature helps you plan your work, schedule meetings, and track deadlines more effectively.

## Features

### Calendar Views

The calendar supports three different view modes:

1. **Day View**: Shows hourly time slots for a single day with all events and time entries
2. **Week View**: Displays a weekly grid with events across 7 days
3. **Month View**: Traditional monthly calendar with events displayed on each day

### Event Management

#### Event Types

- **Event**: General calendar events
- **Meeting**: Scheduled meetings with clients or team members
- **Appointment**: One-on-one appointments
- **Reminder**: Simple reminders for tasks or deadlines
- **Deadline**: Important deadlines linked to tasks or projects

#### Event Properties

Each calendar event can have the following properties:

- **Title** (required): The name of the event
- **Description**: Detailed description of the event
- **Start Time** (required): When the event starts
- **End Time** (required): When the event ends
- **All-Day**: Mark event as all-day (no specific time)
- **Location**: Physical or virtual location
- **Color**: Custom color for visual organization
- **Reminder**: Set reminder (5, 15, 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 1 day before)

#### Associated Items

Events can be linked to:

- **Project**: Associate event with a specific project
- **Task**: Link event to a task for better tracking

### Recurring Events

Create events that repeat on a schedule:

- Set recurrence pattern using RRULE format

- Set an optional end date for the recurrence

### Integration with Tasks and Time Entries

The calendar automatically displays:

- **Tasks with due dates**: Shown as badges on their due date

## Database Schema

### CalendarEvent Model

```python
class CalendarEvent(db.Model):
    id = Integer (Primary Key)
    user_id = Integer (Foreign Key to users.id)
    title = String(200) (Required)
    description = Text
    start_time = DateTime (Required, Indexed)
    end_time = DateTime (Required, Indexed)
    all_day = Boolean (Default: False)
    location = String(200)
    event_type = String(50) (Default: 'event', Indexed)
    
    # Associations
    project_id = Integer (Foreign Key to projects.id)
    task_id = Integer (Foreign Key to tasks.id)
    client_id = Integer (Foreign Key to clients.id)
    
    # Recurring events
    is_recurring = Boolean (Default: False)
    recurrence_rule = String(200)  # RRULE format
    recurrence_end_date = DateTime
    parent_event_id = Integer (Foreign Key to calendar_events.id)
    
    # Reminders and customization
    reminder_minutes = Integer
    color = String(7)  # Hex color code
    is_private = Boolean (Default: False)
    
    # Timestamps
    created_at = DateTime
    updated_at = DateTime
```

### Relationships

- `user`: Many-to-one relationship with User
- `project`: Many-to-one relationship with Project
- `task`: Many-to-one relationship with Task
- `client`: Many-to-one relationship with Client
- `parent_event`: Self-referential for recurring event instances
- `child_events`: One-to-many relationship for recurring event series

## Migration

The calendar feature is added via Alembic migration:

```bash
# Migration file: migrations/versions/034_add_calendar_events_table.py
flask db upgrade
```

This creates the `calendar_events` table with all necessary indexes and foreign key constraints.

## Permissions

- **Users** can:
  - Create their own events
  - View their own events
  - Edit their own events
  - Delete their own events
  - View events linked to their assigned tasks

- **Admins** can:
  - View all events (except private events of other users)
  - Edit any event
  - Delete any event

## Best Practices

### Event Organization

1. **Use Colors Wisely**: Assign colors to different event types for quick visual identification
   - Blue (#3b82f6) for regular meetings
   - Red (#ef4444) for deadlines
   - Green (#10b981) for client appointments
   - Purple (#8b5cf6) for personal events

2. **Link to Projects**: Always link events to projects when relevant for better reporting

3. **Set Reminders**: Use reminders for important meetings to avoid missing them

4. **Use Recurring Events**: Set up recurring events for weekly meetings instead of creating them manually

### Performance Tips

1. The calendar loads events for the visible date range only
2. Large organizations should consider archiving old events (older than 6 months)
3. Use the filters to focus on what's important

### Integration with Workflows

1. **Task Planning**: Create events for task work sessions
2. **Client Meetings**: Link meetings to clients for better relationship tracking
3. **Project Milestones**: Use deadline events for project milestones
4. **Time Blocking**: Create events to block time for focused work

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Showing

1. Check date range - ensure events fall within the visible calendar range
2. Verify filters - ensure event type is not filtered out
3. Check permissions - private events are only visible to their creator

### Cannot Edit Event

- Verify you are the event owner or an admin
- Check that the event still exists
- Ensure you're logged in with the correct account

### Recurring Events Not Working

- Verify RRULE format is correct
- Check that recurrence end date is after start date
- Ensure parent event exists for child instances

## Technical Details
