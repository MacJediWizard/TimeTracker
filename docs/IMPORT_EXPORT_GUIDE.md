## Import Guide

### CSV Import

#### CSV Format

The CSV file should have the following columns:

```csv
project_name,client_name,task_name,start_time,end_time,duration_hours,notes,tags,billable
Project A,Client A,Task 1,2024-01-01 09:00:00,2024-01-01 10:30:00,1.5,Meeting notes,meeting;planning,true
Project B,Client B,,2024-01-01 14:00:00,2024-01-01 16:00:00,2.0,Development work,dev;coding,true
```

#### Column Descriptions

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `project_name` | Yes | Name of the project |
| `client_name` | No | Client name (defaults to project name if not provided) |
| `task_name` | No | Optional task name |
| `start_time` | Yes | Start time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS or ISO format) |
| `end_time` | No | End time (leave empty if providing duration_hours) |
| `duration_hours` | No | Duration in hours (alternative to end_time) |
| `notes` | No | Notes or description |
| `tags` | No | Comma-separated tags (use semicolon to separate multiple tags) |
| `billable` | No | true/false (defaults to true) |

#### Supported Date Formats

- `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (e.g., 2024-01-01 09:00:00)
- `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` (ISO format)
- `YYYY-MM-DD` (assumes midnight)
- `DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS`

#### Steps to Import CSV

1. Download the CSV template: Click "Download Template"
2. Fill in your time entries data
3. Click "Choose CSV File" and select your file
4. The import will start automatically
5. Check the Import History section for results

#### Handling Errors

If some records fail to import:

- Common errors include:
  - Invalid date formats
  - Missing required fields (project_name, start_time)
  - Invalid duration values
- Fix the errors in your CSV and re-import

## Export Guide

### GDPR Data Export

Export all your personal data for compliance with data protection regulations.

#### What's Included

- User profile information
- All time entries
- Projects you've worked on
- Tasks assigned to you
- Expenses and mileage records
- Comments and notes
- Focus sessions
- Saved filters and preferences
- Calendar events
- Weekly goals

#### Steps to Export

1. Choose export format:
   - **JSON**: Single file with all data in JSON format
   - **ZIP**: Multiple CSV files + JSON file in a ZIP archive
2. Click the export button
3. Wait for export to complete (usually < 1 minute)
4. Click "Download" when ready
5. Exports expire after 7 days

#### Export Formats

**JSON Export:**
```json
{
  "export_info": {
    "user_id": 1,
    "username": "john.doe",
    "export_date": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
    "export_type": "GDPR Full Data Export"
  },
  "user_profile": {...},
  "time_entries": [...],
  "projects": [...]
}
```

**ZIP Export:**
- `export.json` - Complete data in JSON
- `time_entries.csv` - Time entries
- `projects.csv` - Projects
- `expenses.csv` - Expenses
- etc.

---

### Filtered Export

Export specific data with custom filters.

#### Available Filters

- **Project**: Export only specific project data
- **Billable Only**: Export only billable entries
- **Data Types**: Choose what to export (time entries, expenses, etc.)

#### Steps to Export

1. Click "Export with Filters"
2. Configure your filters
3. Choose export format (JSON or CSV)
4. Click "Export"
5. Download when ready

---

### Backup & Restore (Admin Only)

#### Creating Backups

Admins can create full database backups:

1. Click "Create Backup"
2. Wait for backup to complete
3. Download the backup file
4. Store securely (backup includes all system data)

#### What's Included in Backups

- All users
- All projects and clients
- All time entries
- All expenses and related data
- Tasks and comments
- System settings
- Invoices and payments

#### Restoring from Backup

⚠️ **Warning**: Restore will overwrite existing data!

1. Click "Restore Backup"
2. Select a backup file: **JSON** (Export-style backup from this page) or **ZIP** (full system backup from Admin or scheduled backups; same restore as Admin → Backups → Restore)
3. Confirm restoration
4. Wait for restore to complete
5. Review Import History for results (JSON restores only; ZIP restores do not create import history entries)

**Full ZIP restore and concurrent use**: A ZIP restore uses the same pipeline as **Admin → Backups → Restore** (`pg_restore --clean` on PostgreSQL). While restore runs, the database schema may be temporarily missing or inconsistent; other browser tabs or API clients can see database errors until the job finishes. The app sets an internal “restore in progress” flag so some global template logic avoids extra queries during that window, but you should still treat restore as **maintenance** (quiet period or stop traffic) for predictable behaviour. Details: [Backup and full archive restore](admin/BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md).

#### Best Practices

- Create backups regularly (daily or weekly)
- Test restore process in non-production environment
- Store backups in multiple locations
- Keep backups for at least 30 days

## Troubleshooting

### Import Issues

**Problem**: CSV import fails with "Invalid date format"
- **Solution**: Check date format matches supported formats. Use YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

**Problem**: "Project name is required" error
- **Solution**: Ensure every row has a project_name value

**Problem**: Toggl/Harvest import fails
- **Solution**: 
  - Verify API credentials are correct
  - Check date range is valid
  - Ensure you have access to the workspace/account

**Problem**: Import stuck in "processing" status
- **Solution**: 
  - Wait a few minutes (large imports take time)
  - Check Import History for errors
  - Try re-importing with smaller date range

### Export Issues

**Problem**: Export download says "expired"
- **Solution**: Create a new export (exports expire after 7 days)

**Problem**: Export file is empty
- **Solution**: Check that you have data in the selected date range/filters

**Problem**: ZIP export won't extract
- **Solution**: Ensure download completed fully, try re-downloading

## Developer Guide

### Adding New Import Sources

To add support for a new time tracker:

1. Create import function in `app/utils/data_import.py`:

```python
def import_from_new_tracker(user_id, credentials, start_date, end_date, import_record):
    """Import from new time tracker"""
    # Fetch data from API
    # Transform to TimeTracker format
    # Create records in database
    # Update import_record progress
    pass
```

2. Add route in `app/routes/import_export.py`:

```python
@import_export_bp.route('/api/import/new-tracker', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def import_new_tracker():
    # Handle import request
    pass
```

3. Add UI in template `app/templates/import_export/index.html`

### Adding New Export Formats

To support a new export format:

1. Add export function in `app/utils/data_export.py`
2. Update export routes to handle new format
3. Add format option in UI
