"""
Ratchet down silently-swallowed exceptions.

The codebase has ~511 broad `except Exception:` handlers, 186 of which do nothing but
`pass`. Those hide real faults: e.g. main.dashboard() falls back to recomputing
donation stats when DonationInteraction raises, so a genuine database error surfaces
only as a slow page.

Fixing all 186 at once is not realistic, so this enforces a budget instead: the count
may go down but never up. Lower MAX_SILENT_EXCEPTS as handlers are triaged.

A handler is "silent" when its entire body is `pass` (optionally preceded by comments).
Replace with one of:
    except Exception:
        logger.debug("...", exc_info=True)   # genuinely optional
        logger.warning("...", exc_info=True) # degraded, should be known
or fix the underlying bug.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_silent_excepts.py            # enforce the budget
    python scripts/check_silent_excepts.py --list     # show every occurrence

#: The fork measured 210 before the v5.13.4 merge and 208 after, so the merge lowered the
#: count rather than raising it. Drive this back toward 202 as fork handlers are triaged.
